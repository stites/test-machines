# Program which produces a long data-file simulating a first-order Markov
# chain, which in turn models drift on a ring with a preferred direction.
# The first input is the number of states.  The second is the probability of
# moving forward, the third the probability of moving backwards.  The fourth
# and final input is the number of steps to simulate.
# The output symbols are unspaced.
# Output is to std-out, use redirects to put in files.
# To be used in conjunction with Kris's state-inference program.
