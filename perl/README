This directory contains the Perl scripts written to provide test cases for
CSSR.  They're all supposed to output information about the generating machine
in a specific format, as well as time series.
- It would have been smarter to write one program which read in a file
  describing the desired machine, and unify the format of that description file
  with the one CSSR uses for its output.  I was not that smart.
- It's been so long that I am not sure all of these programs work
  properly; some may have been abandoned in mid-writing.  See below.

Directory contents (alphabetically):
- all-same-symbol.pl produces constant time series.
- alternating-biased-coins.pl produces time series which deterministically
  alternate between two biased coins (i.e. Bernoulli random variables).
- biased-coin.pl simulates a Bernoulli process.
- biased-drift-on-ring.pl is a first-order Markov process where some number of
  states are arranged in a circle, only transitions between adjacent states
  are allowed, and there is a biased towards moving in one direction or the
  other.
- even-process.pl simulates a two-state deterministic process which is not
  Markov at any finite order ("sofic").
- flip_per_holmes_isbell.pl simulates the "flip" process of Holmes and
  Isbell's 2006 paper.
- foulkes.pl simulates the seven-state process introduced by the oldest
  known paper in this area, by Foulkes in the 1950s.
- hidden-drift.pl: three-state hidden process, with three states in a ring.
  Not sure if this one was ever finished.
- hidden-markov.pl: another three-state hidden process simulator.  Not sure
  if this one was ever finished/debugged.
- misiurewicz.pl: Simulates the "Misiurewicz process", named after a Polish
  mathematician.  Four states.
- noisy-period-two.pl: Process with two states which repeat periodically,
  but noise in the observations.
- periodic-with-noise.pl: repeats an input string, with bits flipped with
  a given probability.
- random-hidden-markov.pl: was supposed to create a random deterministic
  hidden process and then simulate it.  Not sure if this was ever
  finished/debugged.
- snd.pl: The "simple nondeterministic source", a 2-state non-deterministic
  HMM.
- state-periodic-and-synching.pl: Repeat states periodically, noisy
  observations but supposed to be "synchronizing" patterns fixing the
  state.  (Thus generalizing noisy-period-two.pl.)  Not sure this was ever
  finished.
- tricky-hidden-markov.pl: three-state hidden process, where
  identification requires deterministic transitions.

The "alphabet" subdirectory contains:
- binary, the 01 alphabet used for most of these test machines.
- flip_alpha, the four-symbol alphabet for the "flip" process.
