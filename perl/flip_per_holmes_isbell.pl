# Program which produces a time series simulating the "flip" transducer
# of Holmes and Isbell ("Looping Suffix Tree-Based Inference of Partially
# Observable Hidden State", ICML 2006)
# They present the model as a transducer with two hidden states, three
# inputs or actions, "u", "r" and "l", and two outputs or observations,
# "0" and "1".  (They do not name their states.)  In the first state,
# the inputs l and u loop back, and produce a 0, but the action r goes
# to the other state and produces a 1.  In that state, r and u loop
# back, emitting 0s, and l switches states, producing a 1.
# They claim to run CSSR on this, with the "actions [i.e., inputs] chosen
# at random".  If one did that and just observed the outputs, both
# states would produce 0 with probability 2/3, 1 with probability 1/3,
# and this would just be a biased coin, so their simulations would make
# no sense at all.  I think they must give it input-output pairs to
# predict.  Then we have a five-symbol alphabet, "l0", "l1", "r0", "r1"
# and "u0", with probabilities and transitions as follows:
# In state A:
### "l0" -> A, prob. 1/3
### "l1" forbidden
### "r0" forbidden
### "r1" -> B, prob. 1/3
### "u0" -> a, prob. 1/3
# In state B:
### "l0" forbidden
### "l1" -> A prob. 1/3
### "r0" -> B prob. 1/3
### "r1"  forbidden
### "u0" -> B prob. 1/3
# To accomodate CSSR, I will use a five-letter alphabet, where lower-case
# letters are accompanied by 0s, upper-case by 1s, i.e.
# "l0" <-> "l", "l1" <-> "L", "r0" <-> "r", "r1" <-> "R", "u0" <-> "u"
# Thus, the suffixes l, L, r and R are all resolving, and only u* is
# ambiguous.
# We pick an initial state equiprobably.

# The first input is the number of steps to simulate.  That is the only
# input.
# The output symbols are unspaced.
# Output is to files named TMD_foo.
# To be used in conjunction with Kris's state-inference program.
